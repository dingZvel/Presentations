## NewSpeak
1. _**Doublethink**_ : The method of directly controlling thought

2. _**Crimestop**_ : to rid oneself of unwanted thoughts that interfere with the ideology of the Party
> The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive. Crimestop, they called it in Newspeak.


> He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself with propositions——'the Party says the earth is flat', 'the party says that ice is heavier than water'——and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them.

## Reflections
- In this novel, a realistic question is raised, in that darkest society, winston's choice is a struggle, and what about you? Assuming you are under the same political pressure and stranded in the same way, will you fight back?

---
## Reflections
- Rome was not built in a day, so was the world. In your daily life, you may perceive something are so "1984". I do not mean the political stuff only. There are songs, films, entertainments, even the ways of living exit. They don't force you to take them, but they do have influent the majority of the society, they are pushing the world to the place without darkness, and steal your mind to concern those meaningless things. Watch out, stop swimming in the unconcious pool before drowning.
